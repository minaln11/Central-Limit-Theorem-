# Distributions and Central-Limit-Theorem-

The project involves in-depth exploration of two datasets: human heights and research paper citations to understand data distributions and apply the Central Limit Theorem(CLT)

Human heights dataset : We analyze human heights and compute descriptive statistices and visualize the data distribution. For the research paper citation data we analyze the data, finding no missing or unreasonable values, and compute mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range. The histogram of the citations data does not resemble a normal distribution, showing a spread-out pattern. Further the principles of Central Limit Theorem are demonstrated and additionally Pareto Distribution is explored.
